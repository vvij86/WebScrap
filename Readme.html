    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Q1: What is GPT-4o?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
            GPT-4o, released in May 2024, is a multimodal AI model developed by OpenAI. The "o" stands for "Omni," reflecting its capability to process and generate text, images, and audio. It is faster and more capable than its predecessor, GPT-4, offering enhanced conversational abilities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Q2: How does GPT-4o mini differ from GPT-4o?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
            GPT-4o mini, introduced in July 2024, is a smaller and more cost-effective version of GPT-4o. Despite its reduced size, it surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo in both textual intelligence and multimodal reasoning, supporting a wide range of languages.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Q3: What is o1, and what are its capabilities?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
            Released in December 2024, o1 is an AI model designed to solve complex problems by spending more time "thinking" before responding. This deliberate approach leads to higher accuracy in tasks such as competitive programming, mathematics, and scientific reasoning.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Q4: How does o1-mini compare to o1?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
            o1-mini, introduced as a preview in September 2024, is a smaller and faster variant of the o1 model. It was designed for tasks requiring complex reasoning, scientific understanding, and coding capabilities, offering a more efficient alternative to the full o1 model.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Q5: What is o3-mini, and what makes it unique?</h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
            o3-mini, released in January 2025, is a lightweight and efficient version of the o3 model. It offers advanced reasoning capabilities at a lower cost, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Notably, it has been recognized for its competitive performance and cost-effectiveness in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
        </p>
